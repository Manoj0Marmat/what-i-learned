# Diverge

When changes made to the same file or files in different branches and these changes cannot be automatically merged together.
It means that the branches have changes that are not present in the other branches.
This can create conflict that needs to be resolved before the branches can be merged together.

###### Ways to Resolve

```javascript
git merge   //or
git rebase
```

> [NOTE]
> Regularly check and update branches to avoid significant divergences
