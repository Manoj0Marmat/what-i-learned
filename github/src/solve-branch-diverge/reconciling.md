# Reconciling

It refers to the process of merging or integrating changes from two or more branches that have [diverged](./diverge.md).

To reconcile branches, we can use the `git merge` or `git rebase` command.

```javascript
git merge   //combines the changes from two branches into a new commit.
git rebase  //rewrites the commit history of one branch onto another.
```

Both of these commands can help us to integrate changes from multiple branches and reconcile any conflicts that arise.
