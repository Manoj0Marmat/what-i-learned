# Composition

Has-a relationship is similar to **Whole&Part** relationship, where one object is used by another objects as it's property.

##### Example

1.  Car has an Engine

    ```lua
        +----------+           +-------------+
        |    Car   |           |  Engine     |
        +----------+           +-------------+
        |  make    |           |  model      |
        |  engine  |<--------+ |  horsepower |
        |  year    |           +-------------+
        |  model   |
        +----------+
    ```

    ###### Engine Blueprint Class

    ```java
    class Engine{
        String model;
        double horsePower;

        public Engine(String model, double horsePower){
            this.model = model;
            this.horsePower = horsePower;
        }
    }
    ```

    ###### Car Blueprint Class

    ```java
    class Car{
        String make;
        Engine engine;
        int year;
        String model;

        public Car(String make, Engine engine, int year, String model){
            this.make = make;
            this.engine = engine;
            this.year = year;
            this.model = model;
        }
    }
    ```

    ###### Car User Logic Class

    ```java
    Car jaguar = new Car("make", new Engine("x012", 289.9), 2022, "jx02");
    ```

2.  House has Room

    ```

    ###### Room Blueprint class

    ```java
    class Room{
        int number;
        String type;
        int size;
        public Room(int number, String type, int size){
            this.number = number;
            this.type = type;
            this.size = size;
        }
    }
    ```

    ###### House Blueprint class

        }
    }
    ```
